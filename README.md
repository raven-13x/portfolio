## Welcome to my portfolio
This repo consists of both personal and academic projects that I feel represent my strengths as a developer.

## In Progress - AI/ML_Alzheimers
See below for details

Note: Academic project, so commits aren't being made directly to this repo

## Introduction
As a data scientist you will select a problem from the attached “Scenario List,” build a suitable AI
or ML model, and automate the entire model lifecycle from development to deployment. You will use 
the Cloud Academy Lab Environment found in the Web links section. The project documentation should 
list APIs, SDKs, and libraries used.

## Scenario
The individual scenario will be found in the “Scenario List” in the Supporting Documents section.

## Requirements
You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed 
criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more 
than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the 
course.

**A. Create your own subgroup and project in GitLab using the provided "GitLab" and the "GitLab How-To
" web links by doing the following:**
   - Clone the Project to the IDE
   - Commit with a message and push when you complete each requirement listed in parts B-G
   - Submit a copy of the GitLab repository URL in the "Comments to Evaluator" section when you submit
     this assessment
   - Submit a copy of the repository branch history retrieved from your repository, which must include
     commit messages and dates

Note: You may commit and push whenever you want to back up your changes, even if a requirement is 
not yet complete

Note: Wait until you have completed all the following prompts before you create your copy of the 
repository branch history

**B. Describe which problem you want to solve within the scenario from the attached "Scenario List"
including the following:**
   - Reasoning behind your choice
   - Goal in approaching the problem with artificial intelligence and machine learning

**C. Prepare your data using the dataset that corresponds to your chosen problem by doing the 
following:**
   - Normalize and clean the data
   - Categorize the data using clustering where appropriate

**D. Identify the algorithm you will use to build yoru artificial intelligence and machine learning
model**
   - Describe which other algorithms you considered and the pros and cons of each

**E. Discuss how you would improve the model if the size of the dataset was increased or if you had
more computing power**

**F. Discuss how the performance and efficiency of the model will be optimized**

**G. Identify three potential ethical issues in your chosen model**
   - Describe which concerns need to be mitigated in the dataset before proceeding
   - Explain the strategies for mitigating these issues in the dataset
   - Analyze the ethics of the model design
   - Explain the strategies for mitigating these issues in the model design

**H. Acknowledge sources, using APA-formatted in-text citations and references for content that is
quoted, paraphrased, or summarized**

**I. Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission**

## Written Responses
**B. Describe which problem you want to solve within the scenarios from the attached "Scenario 
List" including the reasoning behind your choice and the goal in approaching the problem with
artificial intelligence and machine learning**

I've chosen scenario 3, Alzheimer's Disease. Due to the complex relationships between Alzheimer's 
and patient demographics, AI is an appropriate tool here. Additionally, using the results for 
further research reduces ethical issues significantly. The COVID-19 and Hospital Staff Management 
scenarios would find well written reports or dashboards as suitable solutions. The School Attendance 
scenario can inadvertently create/introduce racial, demographic, and/or economic biases; an AI/ML 
solution could end up stigmatizing students. The Animal Incident scenario could result in Animal 
Control officers interpreting normal animal behavior as threatening in areas identified by the 
AI/ML solution.

The data provided for this scenario is a broad medical survey where each row represents different 
demographic groups. The survey contains mixed categorical and numeric data collected from 2015 to 
2022. With this data, the goal is to see if an AI can identify new demographic patterns that support 
new hypotheses for research. More specifically, this is a clustering problem in which age, race, 
gender, and location are used to discover patterns in groups with Alzheimer's related metrics.
