      Welcome to my capstone project for WGU. This web application was designed for the ficticious Springwood Community School Corporation. This is a Learning Management System (LMS)
      used to manage the core aspects of any school corporation's learning operations.<br/><br/> The goal of this app is to provide a bloat-free, customizable, and cost-effective alternative to other LMS's on the market
      without sacrificing the security, scalability, and performance they provide. Below are the credentials for each of the three test accounts. Simply take a screenshot, write down the credentials, or come back to the sign-in page for this dialog.<br/><br/>
